MacroXpnd started as a simple Flex/Bison experiment, its main purpose
is to follow #include directives, but not Precompile into the cryptic
format that gcc -E  alone generates.

We could use gcc -P -E to rid the output of the line numbering, but 
then we loose traceability of where the content has been #included from.
That's what MacroXpnd will do, in its final form the content from the
#include will be clearly marked (probably by gutters or indentation)
showing where its content came from.  The program may also add functionality
to actually track the #ifdef values, and thus show certain sections as
excluded due to being in a #ifndef or #ifdef directive.
